# dogOrCatClassifier

A basic Dog or Cat classifier built using fastai deep learning library and hosted on huggingface spaces. The core model trained and used is the RESTNET18 model. Although not a great project, I still believe it's a nice place to start with learning ML/DL stuff.

Note: Don't get overwhelmed seeing this, I promise this is one of the easiest projects I have worked on. Before I started creating this, I was in the belief that you need to know lots of complex math, algorithm knowledge etc to build a basic model. But, trust me, that hard part is already done for us by many great libraries. You just need to invoke them like a function. If you want to start with ML/DL as a beginner, I highly recommend fastai's course for you all(course.fast.ai is the website)
